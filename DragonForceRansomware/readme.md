# DragonForce Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)

DragonForce is a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) affiliate program that has gained notoriety for using two versions of ransomware to target its victims. Many DragonForce ransomware attacks are customized to each victim to maximize their impact. The threat actors achieve this by leveraging tactics such as changing the filename extensions of encrypted files and terminating specific processes and services. 

## Ransomware Builder

DragonForce's ransomware builder allows affiliates the capability to specify exactly which processes the ransomware should terminate. This ensures the successful encryption of all important data on the victim’s devices.

## Double Extortion Technique

The operators of DragonForce utilize a double extortion technique, where they:

1. **Exfiltrate Sensitive Data**: In addition to encrypting the victim’s data, DragonForce operators steal sensitive information.
2. **Demand Ransom Payment**: They demand a ransom payment from their victims in return for:
   - A decryptor to restore access to encrypted data.
   - A "promise" that the stolen data will not be released.

This dual-pronged approach puts significant pressure on victims, as they face the loss of access to their data and the potential exposure of confidential information. This exposure can lead to severe damage to their reputation, privacy, or business continuity.

## Impact on Victims

Victims are pressured to comply with attackers’ demands due to the risk of:

- **Data Loss**: Encrypted data can cripple operations if not restored.
- **Data Exposure**: Public release of sensitive information could lead to reputational damage, privacy violations, and legal consequences.

DragonForce's tactics highlight the evolving threat landscape of RaaS and the increasing sophistication of ransomware attacks targeting both data security and privacy.
